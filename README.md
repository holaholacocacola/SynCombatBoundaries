# SynCombatBoundaries
#### Synthesis compatibility patcher for disabling combat boundaries and controlling which types of npcs can swim in combat

This is similar to [Follow Me and Swim After Me](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7026) . The only difference(besides working with all mods) is that you can configure which actors you want to be able to swim.
Enabling/Disabling is based on keywords. The default settings will only enable npcs and vampire races to swim. If you want every actor but vampire/undead to swim, then disable those options.

Requirements:
------------
[Synthesis Patch Framework](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/wiki/Installation).

### Settings
##### Settings can be configured by in the settings tab in the synthesis gui. Default settings are identical to the original mod.

-  AllowNpcs - `bool`: Allow Npcs to swim in combat
-  AllowCreatures - `bool`: Allow Creatures to swim in combat
